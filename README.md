# Project 2 - Yelp APp

Yelp app is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: 10+

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Search results page
   - [x] Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height.
   - [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
   - [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).
- [x] Filter page. Unfortunately, not all the filters are supported in the Yelp API.
   - [X] The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), distance, deals (on/off).
   - [X] The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
   - [X] You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states.
   - [X] Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.
   - [X] Display some of the available Yelp categories (choose any 3-4 that you want).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Search results page
   - [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
   - [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [] Filter page
   - [ ] Implement a custom switch instead of the default UISwitch.
   - [X] Distance filter should expand as in the real Yelp app
   - [X] Categories should show a subset of the full list with a "See All" row to expand. Category list is [here](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/category_list).
- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. One of the major issues i ran into was the drop down filters where a user drops down the list of filters and wants to close it, a pretty evident bug in my app.
2. Auto layout of using multiple prototype cells, specifically sections
3. how do i persist filter state between apps.
